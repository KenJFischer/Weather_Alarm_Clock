# Speaking_Weather_Alarm_Clock
 An alarm clock that will read out the weather forecast when it goes off.

 This is a small application that will automatically retrieve the weather at a user-specified time. At that point, if the user selected the option, it can read out the weather using customizable sound files. It displays cartoon images (provided by OpenWeather) of the current weather, a 12 hour summary of the forecast, and then a detailed breakdown of the forecast including temperature, precipitation, and cloud cover data.
 
 If you want to use this there are a few files that you have to provide. These should be placed inside a folder called "res" that is in the same directory as the application's .exe.
 See this Drive link for a listing/examples of all the necessary files: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1x_GWmtGdnuvza8Kjzw_PgI9FifKGeYnm?usp=sharing
 Feel free to use these files or to replace them with your own.
 You'll also need a file called "Default ZIP Code.txt" that goes in the same directory as the .exe.
